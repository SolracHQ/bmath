# Changelog

## Version 0.4.0
- Added support for comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=).
- Implemented conditional expressions (if, else, elif, endif).
- Added support for boolean literals (true, false).
- Implemented logical operators (&, |) with short-circuit evaluation.
- Added support for recursive functions and examples.
- Added local keyword to declare variables in the current scope.

## Version 0.3.0
- Added support for vectors and operations over vectors.
- Enabled native functions (host language functions) to access interpreter capabilities.
- Core library add the following native functions:
  - `vec(size, generator)` - Creates a vector of `size` elements using the `generator` function.
  - `dot(a, b)` - Calculates the dot product of vectors `a` and `b`.
  - `nth(a, index)` - Returns the element at `index` in vector `a`.
  - `first(a)` - Returns the first element of vector `a`.
  - `last(a)` - Returns the last element of vector `a`.

## Version 0.2.0
- Introduced lambda expressions (user-defined functions) and environments.
- Functions are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables.

## Version 0.1.0
- Implemented core arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^).
- Added support for native function calls.
- core library consist on:
  - `exit()` - Exits the program.
  - `pow(a, b)` - Raises `a` to the power of `b`.
  - `sqrt(a)` - Returns the square root of `a`.
  - `floor(a)` - Returns the floor of `a`.
  - `ceil(a)` - Returns the ceiling of `a`.
  - `round(a)` - Rounds `a` to the nearest integer.
